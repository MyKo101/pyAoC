## Advent of Code

This is my work through the historic Advent of Code
activities, tracking my progress here and including
the python code used to solve the problems.

In order to complete the Advent of Code, I have created
an AoC Decorator which, when called, passes the relevant
data files into the `solve()` function

My own data (supplied by Advent of Code) is included in
each directory and each file can be run (provided that the
AoCDecorator.py file is in the project root)
